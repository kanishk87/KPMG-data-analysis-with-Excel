**Task 5:** Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis 
Objective: Calculate and analyze the customer lifetime value to identify the most valuable customers.
**1. CLV Calculation:**
○ Use the formula
○ Calculate CLV for each customer using transaction data.
**Formula
CLV=(Average Purchase Value×Purchase Frequency)×Customer Lifespan
Average Purchase Value (APV):**
● This is the average amount of money a customer spends in a single purchase.
APV=Total Revenue/ Number of purchases
● Total Revenue is the sum of all revenues generated from all purchases. You can get the total revenue
by using Transactional data.
● Number of Purchases is the total count of all transactions of that customer.
**Purchase Frequency (PF):**
● This is the average number of times a customer makes a purchase in a given period.
PF= Total Number of Transactions / Number of Unique Customers
Customer Lifespan (CL):
● This represents the average number of years a customer remains active.
● In your dataset, this is represented by the tenure column in the Customer Demographic dataset.
**2. Segment CLV Analysis:**
○ Show average CLV by wealth_segment.
○ Analyze the relationship between CLV and customer demographics (e.g., gender, job industry).
